        <h5>About The Project</h5>
        <p> The main challenge was coming up with a unique concept of communicating with a voice assistant, since it's already been done - but not in a vehicle. We had to think how human beings communicate with each other: with gaze, intonations and certain verbal phrases. We incorporated the way we talk to other humans into a voice user interface system. And provided visual representation to the actions the assistant was taking.
               Such a system was aimed for drivers in a level 4 autonomous vehicle.

            <h5>Problem</h5>
            <p> How will the riders of level 4 autonomous cars communicate with the car's voice user interface system while the need to hold the steering at all times would have been eliminated. This should be done while keeping in mind that the car's seating arrangement will most probably be redesigned and the seats could face away from the wind shield.

                <h5>Analysis and Ideation</h5>
                    <p>the ideation started off with a brainstorming session on what the Voice User Interface system should look like and do. In addition, a survey was conducted in order to get a general feeling for what users think about voice assistants currently. 
                        The survey helped answered the questions like;
                    <ul>
                        <li> How should the assistant look like?</li>
                        <li> Should it even have a visual representation?</li>
                        <li> Should it have emotions? Should it have eyes?</li>
                        <li>How will the user talk to it - like a robot or a regular conversation?</li>
                        <li>What functions will the VUI help with the user?</li>
                    </ul>
                    Following screen show the favourite habit of UX designers, ideation in the form of thinking out loud on the whiteboards and making great use of colorful sticky notes.

            <h3>Wireframes</h3>
            <p>In order to run the user tests, wireframes of the voice user interface was created. It show how the VUI uses the screen in order to indicate what is being listened and show visuals to help what is being said by the system. 
            Here is an example of user setting the destination location.

                <h5>Important Design Decisions</h5>
                <p>After Doing background research and user testing, some important design desicions were made:
                       <li> No face (Cultural constraints)</li> 
                       <p>The VUI will have no face as there are some contradictions that occure occross some cultures, so it only makes sense to avoid such design that may make the product lose certain large group as target users.</p>
                       <li> Feedback in the form of beeps </li>
                       <li> Confirmations in the form of beeps, text, visuals</li>
                       <p>So that the user knows that he has been heard by the system</p>
                       <li> Big or small display based on Highway or in the city drive</li>
                       <p>This will let the driver focus on driving while on busy city roads with small screen for important notifications only, or enjoy the multimedia in with the bigger screen while on highway.</p>
                       <li> Natural communication</li>
                       <p>As it was evident from the background research that the dialogue is an efficient way of communication. It engages the users no matter what their age or technology background is. The natural communication is much more inclusive than the computer commands.</p>
                       <li> Trigger word</li>
                       <p>As the case with most modern day virtual assistants, a trigger word is used to address the system, quite much like you adress a person by their name when shifting focus to them.</p>
                       <li> If car doesn't understand command it will present possible understandings in the form of options “Did you mean...”</li>
                       <li> Inclusiveness (a button to listen to)</li>
                        
                </p>

                    <h3>Storyboarding</h3>
                    <p>Having established the details about the functionality of VUI, a storyboard was created in order to produc the video prototype. The hand drawn sketches are a great way to create the storyboard and make quick changes. The storyboard in this case shows the user story about how a typical day with the Huawei VUI system could look like.
